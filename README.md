React and JSON Server Application

This project is a combination of a React frontend application and a JSON Server backend. It provides a simple setup for building and deploying full-stack web applications with React for the frontend and JSON Server for the backend.

Features
React Frontend:
Utilizes React.js for building interactive user interfaces.
Includes components for managing state, routing, and fetching data from the JSON Server backend.
Built-in support for JSX syntax and component-based architecture.
JSON Server Backend:
Provides a mock REST API server for testing and development purposes.
Allows easy creation of RESTful endpoints for managing data.
Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on JSON data.
Prerequisites

Node.js and npm: Install Node.js and npm from here.
Git: Install Git from here.
React: Basic understanding of React.js and its concepts.
